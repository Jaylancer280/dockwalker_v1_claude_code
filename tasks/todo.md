# Task Board

> Shared between planning and implementation agents. Planning agent writes, implementation agent executes.
> Mark items `[x]` as completed. Remove completed items from the list — see git history for past work.

## Backlog

> Active backlog. Pick items into Queue when ready.
> **Implementation agent: do NOT move items here to defer them. If a todo item
> is too hard, stop and ask — do not unilaterally deprioritise.**

### Business logic / server-side

- **Permanent crew withdrawal auto-revert** — when crew withdraws from a selected permanent posting, employer should decide next step, not auto-revert.
- **Onboarding true atomicity** — `onboard_person` RPC should be fully atomic.
- **Negotiation timeout** — auto-close permanent engagements after X days inactivity.
- **Weekly check-in cron** — periodic nudge for permanent postings with no employer activity.
- **Deactivated user server-side sign-out** — force session invalidation on PERSON.DEACTIVATED.

### Web-only UI

- **OG social sharing image** — see `tasks/founder-drafts.md` § 7.
- **Agent market as discover mode** — let agents browse full market feed.
- **Form validation — styled inline errors** — replace browser-native validation (SUG-012).
- **Invalid URL error pages** — custom error pages for garbage URLs (SUG-013).
- **Edit experience "Unknown vessel" prefix** — seed data issue (SUG-017).
- **Applicant count badge on My Jobs**.
- **Discover filter chips**.
- **Notifications grouping**.
- **Email: List-Unsubscribe header**.

### Testing

- **Resilience tests** — network failure, timeout, retry scenarios.
- **Component tests for Permanent UI**.
- **Component tests for Form Pickers**.

### Deferred — Mobile (blocked, needs Mac + Xcode)

- **Mobile Phase 7: TestFlight validation** — app crashes on startup (SIGABRT TurboModule init). Needs Xcode debugger. See `memory/project_mobile_blocked.md`.
- **Mobile Phase 8: Android polish pass**.
- **Capacitor removal** — waiting on Phase 7 validation.
- **Mobile OTA update test**.
- **Mobile Docky hooks/screens** — update to match new single-thread API when mobile unblocks.
